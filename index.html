  <h1> Meeting Joe Pearson</h1>
  <h2> Introduction</h2>
  <p> As you may know by now, I am Joe. I am 25 years old and live in Ft. Myers, FL. Currently, I am a student at Florida Gulf Coast University. At Florida Gulf Coast University, FGCU for short, I study computer software engineering. I would like to say thank you for coming onto my page. 
  <br/><br/>Although school takes a lot of time, I have quite a few hobbies. To list a few:
    <ul>
      <li> Sports </li>
      <li> Traveling </li>
      <li> Computers and Games </li>
      <li> Outdoor Activities </li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>
    Upon arriving, I thought school would just be a breeze. Then taking some time accessing what was happening. I took the time to really catch up and learn what it takes to learn how to program. In my first semester, I have learned so many things about software engineering. Using many websites to learn and better myself. Some the sites that I used were: 
  </p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Hackerrank</li>
    <li>Codeacademy</li>
    <li>Khanacademy</li>
  </ul>
